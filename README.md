# jquery-linear-navigation

jQuery collection plugin that implements the event handlers and model for one-dimensional keyboard navigation.

This plugin is used by [jquery-roving-tabindex](https://github.com/ianmcburnie/jquery-roving-tabindex) and [jquery-active-descendant](https://github.com/ianmcburnie/jquery-active-descendant), and consolidates their common functionality and state. You probably don't need to call this plugin directly.

Docs to come.
